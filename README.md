# Homework2
Due on Wednesday, September 5 by 11:59pm

Use the following link to to create your private github repository for this assignment: 
[homework2]()

The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code, test cases, and documentation files.

Fill in code in the following classes:
- Sphere
- SphereDriver
- HealthProfile
- HealthProfileDriver
- Craps
- StringProcessing

Please read comments above each method. Javadoc documentation is also available in the doc folder. Do not modify the starter code except where the comments explicitly tell you to add your own code. Do not change the structure of the project.

### Submission Instructions

- Your code must (a) compile without any errors, (b) run, and (c) produce the correct output. If the code does not compile or crashes when we run it on a lab machine, it will result in a 0 for the assignment. 
- For some of these classes, the instructor provided basic JUnit tests (during the class, the instructor will demonstrate how to run them). However, if your code passes them, it does not mean it is 100% correct. It is possible to pass some tests and have a bug! You are responsible for testing your code before submitting it.
- Please submit .java files. Do not submit .class files.
- Your code needs to be committed to the correct github repository. Note that we cannot accept code submitted via Canvas or email. 
- Make sure your code follows the style guidelines described in StyleGuidelines.pdf (posted on Canvas). 
- This assignment is individual, no collaboration is allowed. You can go the professor, the TA or CS tutors for help.
